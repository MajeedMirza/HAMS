Home Automation and Monitoring System

### About
The home monitoring and automation system allows users to remotely interact and observe various environmental aspects of their homes remotely through a cellphone app. The system monitors the following:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Smoke, Gas presence, Flame (fire)
- Flooding
- Garage door status and control

In case of an emergency all units of the system will sound an alarm and flash a red LED to alarm the residents in the house, as well as sending mobile notifications in case the residents are outside. 

This project can help reduce damage to usersâ€™ homes by quickly identifying an emergency notifying them in case of an emergency when they are outside. In addition to giving the users the ability to monitor their houses at all times, the system will also allow the users to check on their garage door and open or close it automatically in case someone forgot to close the garage door open or someone got locked out without a key.
